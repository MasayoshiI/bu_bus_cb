# BUsBot

A utility chat-bot for Boston University students to conveniently find out information about the BUs, Boston University's shuttle system.

Currently only supported on Facebook Messenger, but expanding to SMS and more soon!

Try it out! Send a message to @BostonUniversityBUsBot saying "when is the next bus to stuvi2?"
